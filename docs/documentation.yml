      ### Wellio.js is a JavaScript library for converting a LAS 2.0 well log file into a wellio style JSON.
      ### Other documentation here
      ### How to use
      ### How to install
      ### Tests
      Need to figure out why test functions aren't showing here! Is it because there isn't any documentation for them yet? Probably.
      ### How Contribute to Documentation
      Make changes to documentation in the index.js file. 
      This is the description of how the functions run at the top of each function between /** *.
      Alternatively, make change to the documentation.yml file in the docs folder.
      Go to the top level folder. (assuming documentation.js is alredy installed) Run `documentation build -c docs/documentation.yml dist/* -f html -o docs'
      Now CD to docs folder. Run `python3 -m http.server`. You should be able to go to your browser at http://0.0.0.0:8000/ and see the docs. 
      Once you push the repo to github, the docs should be at the top level of the githu pages page plus /docs/index.html
