## Purpose
<b> Wellio.js is a JavaScript library for converting a LAS 2.0 well log file into a wellio style JSON. It was created to enable well logs to be easily visualized on the web.s</b>s

##### You might be wondering...Why Bother? Geologists Use Python.
Although Python is great for data analysis, and it is the language most learned by geologists, it isn't great for building user interfaces that live on the web. If you want to enable that functionality, you need to get well logs into a format JavaScript visualization libraries can consume and that's JSON.

Further explanation on why create wellio is given in the <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/wellio.js/docs/">docs</a>.

## Demos

#### 1. Github pages demo <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/wellio.js/">page</a>: 
Open the demo page running on github pages. Click one of the big blue buttons up top to  open a file loader. You can either use a LAS files already part of the webpage or you can load a local LAS file from your computer. 

If you want to test the 'load local file' feature and don't have any local LAS files, you can quickly get one by going to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js/master/assets/00-01-01-073-05W5-0.LAS">this</a> link and saving the results to a ".las" file using your browser. That is a raw las file for well UWI 00-01-01-073-05W5-0.

#### 2. ObservableHQ demo <a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@justingosses/upload-well-logs-convert-las-to-json-with-wellio-then-visual/2">page</a>:
ObservableHQ is new way to explore and play with JavaScript code. Think Jupyter notebook but in a more reactive and interactive form. It runs JavaScript code instead of Python/Julia/R. There's <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/upload-well-logs-convert-las-to-json-with-wellio-then-visual/2">this</a> demo that uses vega to visualize the well log but is limited to horizontal visualization. There's also <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/a-notebook-using-wellio-js-wellioviz-js-for-quick-looks-of-la"> this </a> demo that uses wellioviz to visualize the well log as people expect it to be visualized in a vertical orientation with shading, etc. 

#### 3. Jupyter Notebook Node.js <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js/blob/master/notebooks/Wellio%20Demo%20in%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20Node.js.ipynb">demo</a>
Wellio can also be worked with in a jupyter notebook running a node.js kernal.

### Data in the demos
Data for the demos is mostly wells from an open source dataset of the <a href="https://ags.aer.ca/publication/spe-006">Mannville Group from Alberta Canada</a>. A preprocessed version of this dataset can be found on <a href="https://dataunderground.org/dataset/athabasca-preprocessed">dataunderground</a> along with many other well dataset.

There are a variety of <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js/issues">issues</a> that need worked. Several of which are suitable for those who are new to JavaScript. 

Please add any suggestions you'd like or bugs you find to the issues.

Docs are a great way to make pull request contributions even if you aren't immmersed in the code base yet.

## Road Map
Right now, the main functionality of wellio.js is LAS file -> Wellio-style JSON. 

There is also functionality to:
- save wellio-style JSON as a .json file.
- load & convert <a href="https://lasio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">LASIO</a>-style json into wellio-style JSON.

In the future, we may add functionality to convert <a href="https://jsonwelllogformat.org/">JSON well log format</as>, or what becomes the unfortunately named JSON-style JSON, to wellio-style json and back.

## Wellio.js & Wellioviz.js
<i>Wellioviz</i> is the visualization companion to <i>wellio</i>!

Where are <i>Wellio</i> is just concerned with the conversion of LAS 2.0 files into JSON, <i>Wellioviz</i> is concerned with making a visualization of the resulting JSON using d3.js v5. This means you can load, convert, and visualize well logs entirely on the web with front-end JavaScript.

## Where To Get Open-Source Well Logs in .LAS format?
You can use the file upload button to load into your browsers memory any LAS files from your local computer. I've also included a few well logs in the /assets/ folder of this repo from the electronic data file below. 

Electronic data (including well logs, tops, etc.) for Athabasca Oil Sands Data McMurray/Wabiskaw Oil Sands Deposit <a href="http://ags.aer.ca/publications/SPE_006.html">http://ags.aer.ca/publications/SPE_006.html Data is also in the repo folder: SPE_006_originalData</a>

Report for Athabasca Oil Sands Data McMurray/Wabiskaw Oil Sands Deposit <a href="http://ags.aer.ca/document/OFR/OFR_1994_14.PDF">http://ags.aer.ca/document/OFR/OFR_1994_14.PDF</a>

You can also find them on USGS and Kansas open data sites as is done in <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/a-notebook-using-wellio-js-wellioviz-js-for-quick-looks-of-la">this Observable notebook</a> that leverages wellio & wellioviz.

#### LAS -> JSON
```var lasjson = function las2json(onelas)```
will give you something like this though in the example below all the data is taken out to save space:
