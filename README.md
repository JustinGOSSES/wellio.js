# wellio.js
#### JavaScript for converting well-log standard .las file format to json format and then back again.

[THIS IS VERY NEW AND IN PROGRESS]
[ONLY TRYING TO GET TO WORK WITH LAS 2.0 RIGHT NOW]

## Purpose
 There currently isn't any .las -> JSON parser that I was able to find. There is <a href="https://lasio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">lasio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/agile-geoscience/welly">welly</a> for python, but nothing to ingest las files in JavaScript. Wellio.js is an attempt to fill that gap, so I can build other stuff. Once you have well data as JSON, many other JavaScript-based things as possible. I'll try to keep those other things separate, except as demos for Wellio.

## Does this upload my well logs to your server? 
Nope, it only loads to your browser's memory and then your browser forgets it when you close the tab.

## Can I see the demo right now?
Yes, open the demo page running on github <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/wellio.js/">here</a>. Click one of the big blue buttons up top to  open a file loader. You can either use a LAS files already part of the webpage or you can load a local LAS file from your computer. 

If you want to test the 'load local file' feature and don't have any local LAS files, you can quickly get one by going to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js/master/assets/00-01-01-073-05W5-0.LAS">this</a> link and saving the results to a ".las" file using your browser. That is a raw las file for well UWI 00-01-01-073-05W5-0.

## Code Organization Summary
This repo contains code for the demo page</a>, which leverages the wellio.js JavaScript file in the js folder. 

#### Wellio.js script will have a few basics functions (not all are written yet)
1. las2json(onelas) : <i>Function that takes a single LAS text file representing a single well and returns an object variable in JSON format for that well.</i>
2. json2las(oneJSON): <i>Function that takes a single json representing a single well and writes a LAS 2.0 file.</i>
3. download(filename, text): <i>Function that takes a filename and text string and writes a file (either json or las) to your designated downloads folder.</i>
4. additional?

#### Demo
Additional to the wellio.js file, there are a variety of files running the demo page at index.html or <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/wellio.js/">here</a>. The main javascript file aside from wellio.js is main.js

<a href="https://github.com/agile-geoscience/g3">G3.js</a> is used to draw a plot of the well log curves. It leverages <a href="https://github.com/d3">d3.js</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/vkiryukhin/vkBeautify">VKbeautify.js</a> is a script for adding spaces and such to JSON to make them prettier when printed.
<a href="https://github.com/google/code-prettify">run_prettify.js</a> does something similar but is focused on making it print nicely into HTML DOM elements. 

## Road Map
Right now, wellio.js just does LAS -> Wellio JSON. There are variety of features that could be added to increase the functionality of wellio and in particular enable cross-communication with other LAS-focused projects. 

Potential cross-communication conversions include:
1. wellio <-> las files (have the las to wellio direction but need the back again conversion)
2. wellio <-> <a href="https://github.com/agile-geoscience/welly">welly</a> objects (python)
2. wellio <-> <a href="https://lasio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">lasio</a> (python)
3. wellio json objects -> wellio_plus json objects  with wellio_plus being defined as having data and functions that go behind the data in a LAS file. 

Examples of wellio_plus data & functions that could be part of the prototype would be:
- common function calls like max, min, average of each curve, etc.
- pick depths
- geographic location
- age of data acquisition 
- non-original curves that are created and used as engineered features for machine-learning.
- other well-centric data points or datasets that might be useful for machine-learning. 


## Where To Get Open-Source Well Logs in .LAS format?
You can use the file upload button to load into your browsers memory any LAS files from your local computer. I've also included a few well logs in the /assets/ folder of this repo from the electronic data file below. 

Electronic data (including well logs, tops, etc.) for Athabasca Oil Sands Data McMurray/Wabiskaw Oil Sands Deposit <a href="http://ags.aer.ca/publications/SPE_006.html">http://ags.aer.ca/publications/SPE_006.html Data is also in the repo folder: SPE_006_originalData</a>

### Why Bother? Geologists Use Python...
While trying to build a machine-learning program to mimic specific geologist's stratigraphic surface picking, I concluded I was limited by the number and quality of my input features. Specifically, I needed more features and the methods I were using to come up with effective ones were too slow. 

I found trying to do well log feature creation in Jupyter notebooks using Python to be too linear and time intensive involving re-writing or re-running too much code in between seeing the results. JavaScript has more interactive and reactive data visualization libraries, so that is driving tool choice. For clarity, I'm using the term reactive in the <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Bret Victor</a> sense, not the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react.js</a> sense. 

Additionally, using JavaScript opens up the possibility of simple widgets that could be run in the browser without needing to install a program on users' computers and the possibility of open-source well log software without needing to know a computer language to do things. 

I'm imagining a reactive style well-log feature creation widget, something like <a href="http://ncase.me/joy/">joy.js</a>,  that would include cross-filtering across multiple figures like in <a href="https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/">dc.js</a>, while also leveraging numpy-style array math, like in <a href="https://deeplearnjs.org/">deeplearn.js</a>. 

*Long story short, I needed a way to load las files and work with them as json in JavaScript in order to build another thing.*
